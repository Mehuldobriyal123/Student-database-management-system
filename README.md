# Student-DataBase-Management-System:

About:-

SQL can also be utilized to accomplish this project. The idea here is to create a project that will be accountable for accumulating students’ records. Most of these track records need to keep details about the students. This information could be the generic details like student’s name, address, performance, attendance, etc, or specific information related to departments like a collection of data.

Features needed:–

The project’s database should contain general details about the students. For instance their address, name, contact information, year of admission, courses, etc.
Additionally, essential details such as files of attendance, results, fees, scholarships, and others should also be incorporated.
